# Endo-Challenge: Data Exploration

Welcome to the **Endo-Challenge**! In this task, you will be working with a dataset related to **endometriosis**, a condition that affects millions of women worldwide. Your goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and prepare the data for potential machine learning models.

## Important Notice: NDA Compliance
Before starting this challenge, you should have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). By participating in this challenge, you agree to keep the dataset and any related information confidential, and you may not share it or use it for any purpose outside of this challenge.

If you have not yet signed the NDA, please contact us immediately before proceeding with the task.

## Objective

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your ability to:
1. **Explore structured data** and generate meaningful insights.
2. **Visualize key patterns** within the dataset.
3. **Communicate your findings** clearly through a well-organized report.

## Dataset

The dataset provided contains various features related to endometriosis diagnosis and patient information. You can find the dataset in the `data/` folder. Each column represents a different feature, and your job is to explore these features to better understand their distribution, relationships, and potential implications.

### Key Tasks:
1. **Data Overview**:
   - Provide a brief summary of the dataset, including the number of rows, columns, and the types of data (categorical, numerical, etc.).
   - Identify missing or inconsistent data, and suggest how you would handle it.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the distribution of key variables (e.g., age, symptoms, diagnostic outcomes).
   - Identify and visualize potential correlations between variables.
   - Detect any outliers or unusual patterns.
   
3. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) that help describe the data. Feel free to use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
   
4. **Insights**:
   - Write a brief summary of your key findings and any insights that could inform further analysis or model building. What features seem most important? What patterns did you notice?

## Tools and Libraries

You are free to use any tools or libraries you are comfortable with. Below are some suggestions:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn** for visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn** for any basic data preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab** for running your analysis. These platforms are great for interactive coding and allow for clear presentation of code, visualizations, and insights in one place.

## Submission

Once you have completed the analysis, please submit your work by:
1. Pushing your analysis to this repository in a folder named `submission`.
2. Ensure that your notebook or script is well-documented, with comments explaining your steps.
4. Including a brief report (e.g., Report.md, final notebook, or any other format) summarizing your insights.
5. Recording a video (5-15 minutes) explaining your exploration and findings. You can upload this video directly to the submission folder in the repository, or provide a private link if hosted elsewhere.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your work will be evaluated based on:
- **Clarity and organization** of the code and report.
- **Depth of the exploratory analysis** and insights derived.
- **Quality of visualizations** and ability to explain trends in the data.
- **Handling of data quality issues**, such as missing or outlier values.

## Deadline

The deadline for submitting your exploration is **November 7**. Please ensure that all submissions are completed before this time.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your insights!
